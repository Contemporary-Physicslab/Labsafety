## General Safety & Security at Applied Physics (AP)

In a professional organization where people are conducting complex experiments with expensive materials, safety is key. Hence, you need to be aware of general safety regulations and are obliged to pass some basic safety tests.

### Responsibilities

Safety is not something we can do on our own. We have a shared responsibility:

```{list-table} Shared responsibility

```

### Emergencies and minor accidents

1. Call the internal alarm number +31(0)15 27 88888.

2. The emergency centre of TU Delft will send the in-house emergency response team (Bedrijfshulpverlening, BHV).

3. If needed, the emergency centre of TU Delft will contact the external emergency services.

```{note}
When in doubt, always call the internal alarm number.
```

```{warning} Internal alarm number

```

### In case of Site alarm/slow whoop

1. First think of your own safety.

2. Secure your work station and leave the building as soon as possible, taking the nearest exit.

3. If possible, warn your colleagues and assist people with disabilities.

4. Go to the nearest assembly point/checkpoint.

### Security at TU Delft
Awareness: Circle of 25 meters

The Circle of 25 is a metaphor for the 25 meters around you.

You take extra care of your surroundings and thereby reduce safety and security risks on the TU Delft Campus.


When something occurs in your circle:

Assess the situation.
- When someone is in direct need of help you call the TU Delft Internal Alarm Number
- For non-urgent matters you contact the Service Desk.


### Campus card

Your campus card is your personal identification card on the campus as it is connected to your NetID. It provides access to:
- exams;
- printer and study facilities;
- entrances to areas (buildings, labs etc.);
- use of machinery after instruction.

Take care of your campus card and do not give it to others!

In case of loss/theft: Report to Service Desk immediately.
